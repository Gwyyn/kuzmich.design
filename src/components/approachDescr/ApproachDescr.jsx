                    When designing websites, more unique challenges may arise and a series of design principles may
                    need to be learned. Although web design is a progressing field, web designers should not reinvent
                    the wheel but adopt modern solutions to each problem and challenge that might emerge.

                    The best-designed website is the one that satisfies the user's expectations, is user-friendly,
                    solves problems, and meets the objective of the brand and its owner, whether it's an individual,
                    organization, or business.
